What is React ?
It is a LIBRARY for developing client side applications
(HTML + CSS + JS/Typescript)

Other popular:
Framework: Angular 
Libraries: Vue, Svelt


Framework: Provides a whole ecosystem and an active environment for the development
Library: It servers a specific purpose and for other functionalities, we needed to develope/get
the developed plugins.

They are used especially to build SPA: Single Page applications
Benefits: ??

Why frameworks or libraries:
> DOM: To prevent low level handlings and get things done in an easy way without
having concerns about most of the things.
> Browser Compatibility: using babel
> Performance: Bundling, Lazyloading and other features (webpack - module builder)
> Modularity, Reusability etc
> Component based development: (login,cart,productlist,payment,shipping) promotes Modularity, Reusability and many more
advantages. Component = UI + operation logic + Model

Javascript
> A scripting language that runs in the browser (paint HTML + CSS)
> Browser provides the run time environment for Javascript
> JS Engines: Chrome: V8, Firefox: SpiderMonkey, IE: Chakra

European Computer Manufacturer's Association: ECMA
> They maintain and come up with the specification standards for scripting languages (Javascript)
> This specifications are implemented by the different vendors of JS Engines

Which version of JS should i use then ?
> Ideally, that which is supported by all engines.
> But, we can have a transpiler that can convert the code we write in par with
latest standards and compile it as per Compatibility. 
Solution: Babel (https://babeljs.io)
> React makes use of babel


Node:
> Runtime environment based on V8.
> A wrapper was written on the Chrome's V8 engine.
> This made it possible to run the Javascript outside the browser.
